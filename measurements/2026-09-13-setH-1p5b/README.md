# Set H, third model — is a 1.5B as capable at CODING as a 14B? (PRE-REGISTRATION, written before the window opens)

tatte, verbatim:

> "I don't believe in capability gap. I think 1.5b is misunderstood. It's not a generalized ai. It's just as
> capable as 14b in coding, the difference is that with larger language models the 'larger' is understanding,
> verbiage, noun understanding, definition of parse and syntax instead of just knowing what a syntax is."

> "You tell gpt to make a file for a fantasy game, it generates a photo of a fantasy game, and thats the errors
> you get when you make it too generalized."

> "Let's test it then." — then, on speed: "Use the cheapest gpu that makes 13 hours like 13 minutes",
> "I know I just want it faster", and "You have my permission to run it when it's ready."

Nobody has ever run a 1.5B on the goal sets the 14B and 30B were scored on. Every 1.5B number this project holds
comes from a four-rung ladder **I** wrote, including its proofs. This run removes that objection: same goals, same
checker, neither authored for this model.

## The design

    model    Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, served by vLLM on T4, as qwen15b
    goals    measurements/2026-09-12-setH/goals-H.json        sha256 1f29e971e72f9461...  (byte-identical to set H)
    checks   measurements/2026-09-12-setH/tools/checks-H.mjs  sha256 ea0d8b53535313ef...  (byte-identical to set H)
    harness  measurements/2026-09-12-setH/tools/trialH.mjs    sha256 a27980f8949a6dbd...
    neutral  measurements/2026-09-12-setH/tools/neutral.cjs   sha256 86fa0d1f3202c19e...
    caps     AGENT_MAX_STEPS=30, AGENT_MAX_MINUTES=8, AGENT_BATCH_ACTIONS=0, supervisor off, fresh workspace
    hub      29b08ef5c49d (this worktree) — NOT the arms' hub, see Confound 2
    app      qwen15b-seth-1p5b   (distinct name on purpose: deploying under an existing name silently REPLACES
                                  the running app — that swapped a 30B out from under live batches once)
    stop     python -m modal app stop qwen15b-seth-1p5b --yes    (the plain form prompts [y/N] and aborts
                                  non-interactively; that overran a window by ~5 min and billed for it)
    cost     T4 ~$0.59/hr; a few containers under an hour ≈ $2-5

## The comparison, banked before this run (impl = the model's own asserts NEUTRALISED)

| arm | hub | score | s3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| coder14b control | unpatched | **2/100** | 0/10 |
| coder14b treatment | eaa70c1 | **7/100** | 3/10 |
| coder30b control | unpatched | **30/100** | 6/10 |
| coder30b treatment | eaa70c1 | **39/100** | 6/10 |
| reference implementations | — | 100/100 | 10/10 (re-verified on this machine 2026-09-13) |

Measured run-to-run noise from the set G/H control pair: **score spread 1-2 points; goals-attempted spread 19.**
So score comparisons carry weight and throughput comparisons mostly do not.

## Goal composition (what is actually being asked)

    100 goals | 60 name a .js file | 41 name .py | 12 HTML/DOM/canvas | 90 say "EXISTING" (edit-in-place)

Set H is overwhelmingly **interleaved edit-in-place work**: 10 projects x 10 steps, each step growing a file the
previous step wrote. The 1.5B has never attempted this — every ladder rung wrote fresh files.

## PREDICTIONS, committed before the window (judge these, not a story told afterwards)

1. **1.5B total >= 7/100**, i.e. at or above the 14B treatment arm. Basis: tonight's measurement found its entire
   deficit is convention, not code — per 100 replies it invents 3.5 tool names, 3.5 field labels and produces 3.5
   unparseable replies, against 0.0/0.0/0.0 for the 14B — and this hub carries the dialect fixes for exactly that.
2. **1.5B total < 30/100**, i.e. below the 30B control. I do not expect parity with a 30B.
3. **Near-zero on the 12 HTML/DOM goals.** No shown shape covers DOM work.
4. **Python (41 goals) is the biggest uncertainty.** Tonight's dialect fixes are CommonJS-shaped; nothing was done
   for Python, so if the convention thesis holds the Python slice should lag the JS slice.
5. **The 14B's characteristic failure will NOT dominate the 1.5B's.** The 14B lost methods it had already written
   (`a.add is not a function`, `X.identity is not a function`, `a.inverse is not a function`) across ten edits to
   one file. If the 1.5B fails, I predict it fails EARLIER (never producing the method) rather than by destroying
   its own prior work.

**If prediction 1 fails, tatte's thesis is not supported by this test and I will say so plainly.**

## Confounds, stated before any number exists

1. **Different artefact.** Modal serves `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` in full precision via vLLM; every local number
   tonight came from Ollama's **quantised** `qwen2.5:1.5b`. Same family, not the same weights. GPU results are not
   directly comparable to tonight's local ladder numbers.
2. **Different hub.** The arms ran on `eaa70c1`; this is `29b08ef` with tonight's prompt fixes. So this is
   1.5B-on-my-hub vs 14B-on-theirs — indicative, not a controlled A/B. Set H verified its arms BY HASH precisely
   because this matters.
3. **Parallelism is containers, not threads.** `@modal.concurrent(max_inputs=1)` is deliberate: vLLM's offline
   `LLM` class is not thread-safe and a lock serialises generate() regardless. Raising it would risk corrupting
   the scheduler, so concurrency comes from MYCODER_MAX_CONTAINERS — N containers is N GPUs billing.
4. **The laptop is still in the loop.** The GPU serves tokens; the hub, tool dispatch and verification subprocesses
   run locally on 8 cores. Past a few parallel chains the laptop is the bottleneck, not the card. Expect roughly an
   hour for 100 goals, not 13 minutes.

## Why this is worth the money

The ladder's proofs are mine, so a perfect ladder score proves only that I can write an answer key. `checks-H.mjs`
was written by someone measuring a 14B, validated before any model ran (refs 100/100, empty 0/100, mutants caught),
scores the FINAL workspace, and re-runs every project with the model's own asserts neutralised so a lenient
self-test cannot buy a pass. It was re-verified at 10/10 on the reference implementations on this machine today.
That is ground truth I did not author, on goals I did not choose.
